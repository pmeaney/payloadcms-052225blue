# blue Template for Blue-Green Deployment of PayloadCMS

>A template ready to turn into a basic Dockerized, Github Actions CICD-deployed PayloadCMS project (e.g. blue-green)

This project serves as a foundation template - dubbed the "blue template" - designed to be used in a basic Docker Compose blue/green deployment architecture.

The naming convention `payloadcms-052225blue` follows a structured pattern: replace the date stamp and color code with the date of your new instance creation. Each deployment instance should have its dedicated repository. For example, this template can be used to create a complete blue-green deployment with separate repositories: `payloadcms052225-blue` and `payloadcms052225-green`.

This template implements a Dockerized CICD deployment of PayloadCMS and PostgreSQL applications, plus a "remote-first, local sync" strategy for migrations and media synchronization. For detailed GitHub repository setup instructions enabling automated CICD deployment, consult the [`Deployment Configuration Guide`](./payloadcms-052225blue/docs-and-extras/GUIDE--Deployment-Configuration.md).



## Project Components:

- **PayloadCMS Application Container**
  - Built via Dockerfile from the official PayloadCMS Template in the `./payloadcms-cms` directory, with strategic enhancements:
    - Optimized Dockerfile
    - Custom entrypoint script
    - Integrated "remote-first, local sync" process for media and migration files, ensuring your local development environment mirrors the production server
  - CICD pipeline automatically publishes your latest version as a containerized image to GitHub Container Registry
    - Plus a shell script to automate secrets upload to Github Repo Secrets, prior to the initial run of the CICD process

- **PostgreSQL Database Container**
  - Deployed directly from the official PostgreSQL image without modifications
  - The `./payloadcms-postgres-db` directory contains basic configuration
  - Set up directly on the server during deployment

Both components are deployed through a comprehensive CICD workflow consisting of three specialized files in `.github/workflows/` - for CMS, Database, and overall orchestration.

**Important:** This project creates dedicated bind mount directories for media and migration files. These are created in the CICD user's home directory at:
  - `/home/ghaCICDDevOpsUser/payloadcms-cms-052225blue__migrations`
  - `/home/ghaCICDDevOpsUser/payloadcms-cms-052225blue__media`


That is to say-- since it's the Github Action's CICD Ssh User which deploys the app to `/home/<your CICD user>` (e.g., `/home/ghaCICDDevOpsUser`)... the location of the migrations & media bind mount directory will be in that particular user's home dir (not your human user's-- so when you log in a as a human you'll need to navigate to `/home/ghaCICDDevOpsUser` to see the migration & media files sitting on the server). The included sync script `sync-from-prod.sh` retrieves these files to configure your local environment to closely match the remote server, streamlining development.

# Custom Next.js Dockerfile & Entrypoint.sh Setup for PayloadCMS

This project includes enhanced Docker configuration tailored specifically for PayloadCMS deployment. The improvements are focused on practical solutions to common deployment challenges.

## Dockerfile Improvements

The standard Next.js Dockerfile has been customized with several practical improvements:

- **PNPM Optimization**: Switched to PNPM exclusively for faster, more reliable dependency management
- **Flexible Build Process**: Added an option to skip Next.js build during image creation
  - Useful when database connectivity is required during build but not available in CI/CD
  - Allows the build to happen after container deployment when database is accessible
- **Database Support**: Added PostgreSQL client to enable connectivity checks
- **Environment Variable Handling**: Better management of environment variables between build stages
- **File Organization**: Improved structure for migrations and runtime files

The modified Dockerfile introduces a multi-stage build process with a dedicated preparation stage that organizes files differently based on the selected build mode. This approach significantly improves deployment flexibility by allowing builds to be completed either during image creation or after deployment when a database connection is available. It also ensures proper file permissions and directory structures are in place, which is critical for PayloadCMS operations, especially when dealing with database migrations and content storage.

## Custom Entrypoint Script

The original Docker setup used a simple start command. We've added an entrypoint script that:

- Checks for required environment variables before starting
- Waits for PostgreSQL database to become available
- Creates and manages database migration directories
- Intelligently detects and applies new migrations
- Handles build completion if deferred from the Dockerfile
- Provides helpful status messages during startup

The entryscript specifically addresses challenges with Next.js builds in the PayloadCMS context by setting the environment variable NEXT_SKIP_DB_CONNECT=true during the build process. This is a crucial workaround because when building the Docker image during CI/CD, the PostgreSQL database doesn't yet exist, but Next.js and PayloadCMS would normally try to connect to it during build time. By setting this flag, the build process effectively bypasses database connectivity requirements, allowing the image to be constructed successfully without an active database connection. This "mock" approach prevents build failures while still ensuring the application will properly connect to the database when actually deployed and running.

## Why These Changes Matter

These modifications solve real-world challenges when deploying PayloadCMS:

1. **Database Dependency**: PayloadCMS often needs database access during build, which isn't available in CI/CD
2. **Migration Management**: Proper handling of database migrations during container startup
3. **Improved Reliability**: Better error handling and state checking

The result is a more robust deployment process that works well in CI/CD environments while maintaining proper database connectivity and migration management.

## Usage

The enhanced Docker setup works seamlessly with the included GitHub Actions workflows, allowing for both:

- Complete builds during image creation (when database isn't needed)
- Deferred builds that complete after deployment (when database access is required)

This flexibility makes the deployment process more reliable across different environments.

## Deployment Options:

### Remote Docker Deployment
The CICD files automatically handle remote Docker deployment once you configure the A. Repo, B. Repo Secrets, and C. the various templated placeholder names, as detailed in the [`Deployment Configuration Guide`](./payloadcms-052225blue/docs-and-extras/GUIDE--Deployment-Configuration.md).

You'll want to clone the project, follow my terraform deployment guide, then follow the Deployment Configuration Guide.

### Local Docker Development

1. Clone the project
2. Launch the local development environment with this command.  It spins up in the background, then tails the logs.
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d && docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f
```

### Helpful commands

- Connect to postgresql, once sshed into server (uses default credentials):
  - `docker exec -it payloadcms-db-052225blue psql -U payloadcms-052225blue-user -d payloadcms-db-052225blue`

### Remote Deployment

### Local Docker After Remote Development

This project follows a **Remote First, Local Sync** strategy.

Which means... to develop a project on the template, you'll need to reploy it to a remote server (1cvpu, 2gb ram minimum).  From there, you can run the `./payloadcms-cms/sync-from-prod.sh` script, which will pull the migration & media directories from the live remote server... down to your local laptop.  From there, you can run the Local Docker Development command `docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d && docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f` and your local environment at `localhost:3000` on your browser should mimic what you see at your live webiste.  It populates your local project with the same setup (database schema & data, and media files) that the project has on your remote server.
